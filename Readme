Please make the following environmental variables if you do not already have them established.
    OUT_DIR: This one might already be set
    OUTPUT_DIR: I created this one, so you most likely will need to make this one. 
    IMG_DIR:  Another new one, this will be the location of some saved png files.
 
 To begin, run av18.c using root. This will ask for three inputs. First, run number, this is an integer value that is associated with the files that will be saved for the momentum distribution. Second, the maximum number for the second exponential, originally set to 0.0107. Third, the slope modifier for the the 2nd exponential, originally set to 1. This will produce two graphs and a single line output file in the OUTPUT_DIR. 


Next run Sim_IS.cpp using c++. It will ask for the run number you used in av18.c. This will produce two large data files in the OUTPUT_DIR.

In order to view the distribution of momentum produced, run Mo_Dist.c in root using the run number from the previous two programs. This produces one histogram of counts of the proton momentum.  


If you like the momentum distribution produced by the previous program, run Sim_root.c to produce a root file with a large number of histograms using the run number from previous programs, some of these histograms have been commented out. Once you run Sim_root.c for two or more runs. 

You may run ratio.c using two run numbers from previous programs. This produces 3 graphs. Two ratios of counts in Xb, one weighted and one unweighted. This also shows the two weighted histograms used for the first ratio plot.
